# Exercise 1 & 2
Create two new activities (Activity3 and Activity4) with different layouts and views
(studentâ€™s choice). In the first activity (MainActivity) include a new button that shows
Activity3 when it is clicked. In Activity3 create another button for showing Activity4.
Finally, when Activity4 is closed, show directly the first activity (MainActivity).

Create two new EditTexts in the first activity (MainActivity) and show their contents in
the two activities created in Exercise 1 (i.e., in Activity3 and Activity4).
